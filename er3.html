  When net neutrality was repealed, the eighth grade hallway was filled with screams of outrage. The internet defines our generation, our jokes, our sense of community and acceptance, our revealer and our escape. Even the most ignorant of my peers were aware of the one thing that could challenge this balance, the repeal of net neutrality.
  </p>
  <p>
  Net neutrality refers to policy implemented in the Obama-era that would treat the internet as a public utility. It prevented Internet Service Providers (ISPs) from limiting the content you could view, forcing websites to pay for faster uploads, and throttling, or slowing down your bandwidth speed. Additionally, without it, you could be paying a plan that would only include certain websites, perhaps even two bundles to use both Netflix and Tumblr, instead of the free range we currently have. By slowing down your internet speed, the ISPs might offer a faster package, causing even more fees that net neutrality didn’t allow.
  </p>
  <p>
  For some people, a few extra dollars in monthly payments doesn’t dent their budget. But with the repeal of net neutrality, minorities and low-income families will be directly affected. These potential new fees hurt those without the resources to pay them, limiting the freedom to have easily available resources to learn, apply for jobs, and become an active member of the community. This can contribute to the cycle of poverty.
  </p>
  <p>
  Many social and civil rights advocacy groups use the internet to reach out to others and organize important events. Stories that deserve to be heard will be lost. Only websites with power and influence can remain afloat with the extra fees to upload content faster for viewers. A powerful tool for change may be lost with the control of the internet in the hands’ of major corporations.
  </p>
  <p>
  In the same way as human rights organizations, small businesses and startups will be scrambling to make an online footprint. They can’t compete with larger companies when regarding advertisements, which are decided by the ISPs, and the ability to pay fees. In a system made for extremely lucrative corporations, smaller businesses will begin to lack exposure and customers. A prized American value is self-made success and it seems as if politicians put their actions where the money is instead. Not to mention that small businesses are an integral part to our economy, the latter something those who are anti-net neutrality fixate on.
  </p>
  <p>
  The main argument of the opponents is that net neutrality inhibits competition, innovation, and investment in ISPs, which directly correlate with the economy. The more competition, they elaborate, the more people have access to the internet. Furthermore, customers can simply change their ISP is they dislike their plan, as if everyone has the flexibility to do so. The opponents forget the financial restrictions many people have and in most places in the United States, the competition between Internet Service Providers isn’t strong. In all truth, their argument seems to be rooted in the bottom line.
  </p>
  <p>
  The list of things companies are now free to do seems dangerous from blocking ideas, websites, and advertisements they don’t agree with from competitors or opposing political platforms from slowing down your internet connection to force you to pay extra fees. Many of these media corporations, however, have promised not to partake in these actions. But we shouldn’t have to rely on their word, we should be able to have the right to access resources to better ourselves as a person and citizen.
  </p>
  <p>
  The internet supports entire families with small blogs. It helps low-income people obtain steady jobs and allows for the homeless to find shelters. There are millions of people who benefit from a free and open network, those who can’t afford the restrictions and exorbitant prices. We cannot let another element of our society be dominated by corporations who don’t care about their customers, but rather the money they bring along. So much of our lives are determined by our class but the internet was a place where everyone could advance and improve their situation. Now it is reserved for the elite and livelihoods are at stake. Net neutrality isn’t a technology issue, it is a human rights issue.
